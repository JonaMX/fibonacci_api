# Fibonacci API Challenge

This repo is my approach for [tango.io](https://tango.io)'s fibonacci challenge.

## Setup

This app use `Ruby on Rails v7` and a ruby version `ruby-3.1.1`, make sure to have this version installed on your local environment. You can use RVM or any other manager of your preference.

```zsh
rvm install ruby-3.1.1
```

Once the specific ruby version is installed, please install the `bundler` gem

```zsh
gem install bundler
```

Now is time to install dependencies

```zsh
bundle install
```
## How to run the app

```zsh
rails server
```

You can visit the following link to validate the server is working http://localhost:3000/fibonacci/5
